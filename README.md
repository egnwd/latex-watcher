latex-watcher
=============

A (very) simple latex file watcher to auto-compile tex files.

Usage
-----

1. You will need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)
2. Copy ```watch.js``` and ```package.json``` into your latex project folder.
3. In your latex project folder, install node dependencies by running ```npm install```.
4. Start the watcher script by running ```npm start```

Notes
-----
Installing dependencies will create a node_modules folder. You can add this to your .gitignore to avoid it being versioned if you wish.
